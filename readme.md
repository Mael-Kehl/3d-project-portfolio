# Portfolio

This project is an interactive portfolio built with the [Three.js](https://threejs.org) library. 

It aims at gathering and showing all my skills while proposing an enjoyable experience. 

I am using [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for all the animations, [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) fo the dependencies and the bundler [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). 

All 3D models have been created with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).



## Setup

Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the build/ directory
npm run build
```
